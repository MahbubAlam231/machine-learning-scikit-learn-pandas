# Machine Learning with scikit-learn and pandas

Includes machine learning classifier and regressors.

## KNN fruit detection

This a KNN ML algorithm for detecting fruits using data captured through a camera.

## BreastCancerPredictAI

Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning.
This project explores the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset to build a machine learning model that can classify tumors as malignant or benign. The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow:

- Data loading & cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering & preprocessing
- Model training & evaluation
- Insights and conclusions

  
Such predictive modeling can support early detection and assist healthcare professionals, though models should never replace medical diagnosis.
